# Python-for-Artificial-Intelligence
Learn and practice python by using these code sets from the beginner to advanced level.

In this lecture series I tried to show the very basic libraries and coding samples which we use in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

As you practice, you will feel more comfortable in coding and will be ready for more advanced examples.

If you need any example please feel free to send me a message.
